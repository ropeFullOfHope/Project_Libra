Project LIBRA
=== XXXX.XX.XX ===
- Game has been completely rewritten to improve code readability, remove bugs and improve performance thanks to new data pack features.
- TAB now displays mob classes too.
- Classes are now displayed differently so they take up less space.
- All tiers of tools and armor are now craftable.
- Tailors now start with Mud Bricks instead of Terracotta.
- Dead players can no longer hit each other.
- There is now a 0.2 second cooldown between right-clicking any usable item, this should prevent accidental active item usage.
- Mobs no longer have a ton of Blast Protection, most have none now.
- Passive abilities are now given as items, so players know they exist.
- All abilities now have a description.
- A ton of work was done on various visual aspects of the game to improve consistency.
- Certain mobs no longer get randomly enchanted weapons, instead they now get a random preset weapon, so their power is more consistent.
- Legendary books are now given to every dwarf class.
- Certain recipes are now actually removed (e.g. rose bushes cannot be crafted into red dye) instead of being replaced with a different recipe (e.g. rose bushes crafting into rose bushes).
- Lapis Block is now craftable.
- Ray scanning now travels through every block that doesn't have physical collision (it used to only travel through some).
- Ray scanning now always comes out of your eyes, even if you are crawling or crouching.
- To not obstruct your vision, particles from ray casting don't show up when ray is still near your eyes.
- Ray scanning is now extremely accurate. Rays now have to get inside a player's hitbox to hit them.
- load and tick mcfunctions have been split up into multiple functions to improve readability.
- Certain items no longer share the same CustomModelData.
- Unbreakable text is now hidden on all abilities.
- Dyed text is now hidden on all mob armor.
- Mob heads no longer have the unbreakable tag.
- Creeper, Ocelot, Hoglin, Silverfish, Spider, Wolf no longer spawn with green particles and a *ding* sound, just like dwarves do.
- Vindicator's boots now look closer to the original Vindicator.
- Firework Rockets now have a more compact lore text.
- Most mobs can now affect other mobs too with their abilities.
- Player hit player detection has been massively improved, so it's now completly consistent.
- Custom enchantments have been introduced. They currently cannot be applied, but the system is very flexible and dynamic, so these can be used anywhere.
- Custom enchantments have a description when present on an item.
- All vanilla advancements have been removed.
- A new advancement was added for killing wilkekids as a blaze, while he's wearing full Fire Prot 4.
- Advancements are now broadcasted in chat.
- 2 new damage types have been added. They both ignore armor, protection enchantment and resistance effect. One of them also ignores invincibility frames. These 2 are used only in specific situations.

= Zombie =
Blast Protection: 16 -> 2
Projectile Protection: 0 -> 2
Fire Protection: 0 -> 2
Iron Sword can now be one of two presets:
- Sharpness 2
- Sharpness 1, Fire Aspect 1
Can no longer get Fire Resistance Potion.
Can no longer rarely get Flint and Steel, Packed Ice, Ender Pearls or a Horse.
-> Reason: I felt Zombies usually had troubles with getting killed by Bows, so they got Projectile Protection. Being able to start with Fire Aspect was added so there is more variety. Fire Resistance Potions are practically useless so they were removed, but Zombies now also have Fire Protection so they don't get hurt by blazes as much. Flint and Steel is quite useless due to the exsistance of Blaze, Packed Ice goes against the rule of mobs not starting with blocks, Ender Pearls and Horse Spawn egg were moved to natures instead (if a nature for them doesn't exsist yet, be patient, it will probably be added in later update).

= Husk =
Blast Protection: 16 -> 2
Projectile Protection: 0 -> 2
Fire Protection: 0 -> 2
Can no longer get Withering Splash Potion.
No longer get's regeneration when affected by Withering.
To comensate, they now start with 2 Splash Potions of Healing.
Hunger Splash Potion effect duration: 10 seconds -> 90 seconds
Can no longer get Fire Resistance Potion.
Can no longer rarely get Flint and Steel, Packed Ice, Ender Pearls or a Horse.
-> Reason: Same reasons as Zombie. Withering immunity is now unique to Wither Skeletons. Hunger Splash Potion was way too weak, so it's duration was buffed to the same amount as the Slowness and Weakness Potions.

= Vindicator =
Blast Protection: 16 -> 2
Projectile Protection: 0 -> 2
Fire Protection: 0 -> 2
Iron Axe can now be one of two presets:
- Sharpness 3, Efficiency 5
- Sharpness 3, Knockback 2
Now properly gives haste to nearby Vindicators.
Can no longer get Fire Resistance Potion.
Can no longer rarely get Flint and Steel, Packed Ice, Ender Pearls or a Horse.
-> Reason: Same reasons as Zombie. Haste effect was fixed so Vindicators are now encouraged to fight together just like other Zombie types.

= Drowned =
Blast Protection: 16 -> 2
Projectile Protection: 0 -> 2
Fire Protection: 0 -> 2
Trident can now be one of two presets:
- Loyalty 3, Channeling
- Riptide 2
Now gives Dolphin's Grace only to nearby Drowned.
Can no longer get Fire Resistance Potion.
Can no longer rarely get Flint and Steel, Packed Ice, Ender Pearls or a Horse.
-> Reason: Same reasons as Zombie. Dolphin's Grace was changed to encourage Drowned to fight together with other Drowned instead of mobs from different classes (excluding Drowned and Guardians). Think of this as the Speed Husks get, but for water.

= Skeleton =
Defense: 6 -> 7
Blast Protection: 16 -> 0
Bow can now be one of two presets:
- Power 4, Infinity, Punch 2
- Power 4, Infinity, Flame
Can no longer get a Crossbow.
Now only gets 1 Arrow.
-> Reason: Crossbows are pretty useless, also Pillagers already exist.

= Wither Skeleton =
Defense: 6 -> 7
Blast Protection: 16 -> 0
Withering Tipped Arrows effect duration: 10 seconds -> 11.25 seconds (visual bug, displays as 1 second, see https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-98310)
Now gets 2 rolls for:
- 8x Slowness Tipped Arrow (11.25 seconds)
- 8x Weakness Tipped Arrow (11.25 seconds)
No longer gets Withering Splash Potion
Withering being replaced with Regeneration is now exclusive to them.
-> Reason: Withering Tipped Arrows were changed for consistency. Made them focus more on debuffs than damage, to make them more different from skeletons.

= Pillager =
Defense: 6 -> 7
Blast Protection: 16 -> 0
Crossbow can now be one of two presets:
- Quick Charge 3, Piercing 4, Continuity
- Quick Charge 3, Multishot, Continuity
Now always gets 16 Firework Rockets
Starting Arrows: 128 -> 1
The new custom enchantment Continuity works like Infinity, but for Crossbows.
-> Reason: Just QoL improvements really.

= Guardian =
Defense: 6 -> 7
Blast Protection: 16 -> 0
Beam can now hit other mobs.
Reduced amount of particles Beam spawns.
-> Reason: Other skeleton variants can hurt each other so Guardians do that now too. Particles reduction is barely noticable, but performance should be better for people with potato PCs.

= Creeper =
Defense: 6 -> 7
Blast Protection: 16 -> 0
Indirect buff from difficulty being increased to Hard. (Explosion deals more damage)
-> Reason: Was nerfed way too hard in my opinion. Changed it back to original self as I never heard anyone complain about creepers.

= Spider =
Defense: 6 -> 7
Blast Protection: 16 -> 0
Spider eye is now actually a spider eye. (Go ahead and eat it if you want to lose that ability.)
Spider eye is now enchanted with Poison Aspect 1 and Blinding 1, both custom advancements.
Spider now has Poison effect immunity.
Cube of Cobwebs spawned by Web ability is now of a different shape.
-> Reason: Because Spiders can now poison other mobs, they were given Poions Immunity just because I though it would be neat. Cobweb shape is an experimental change, I want to see how this will affect the ability. It will likely be reverted if it proves to nerf the ability too much.

= Wolf =
Blast Protection: 16 -> 2
Projectile Protection: 0 -> 2
Fire Protection: 0 -> 2
No longer starts with 6 Wolf Spawn Eggs and a stack of Bones.
Now has a single-use ability that spawns 6 Dogs.
You can no longer breed Dogs.
No longer starts with a Golden Sword with Fire Aspect
Diamond Sword with Sharpness 5 was nerfed to Iron Sword with Sharpness 3
Iron Sword now has the Wolf Rally custom enchantment, which grants your dogs 1 second of Strength 1 every time you hit a player.
Dogs die when the Wolf player dies.
-> Reason: AI Wolves were always just a nuisance, while the player Wolf was the main damage dealer. This was changed so Wolves will now focus more on their AI Wolves which will make them more uniqe compared to Zombie class. AI Wolves being killed alongside the player is there to prevent them from carrying over to the next class you pick. Breeding is disabled to make it easier to balance the class.

= Ocelot =
Defense: 6 -> 7
Blast Protection: 16 -> 0
Mana Steal now actually steals mana and gives it to the Ocelot.
Mana Steal has been nerfed to stealing 30 mana.
Mana Steal can steal mana from other Ocelots.
Disarm now costs mana and has no cooldown.
Disarm no longer gives Slowness effect.
Disarm no longer affects every dwarf around you, now affects only players in front of you.
No longer gets permament Speed 2
Dash ability is back and costs mana.
Dash gives 3 seconds of Speed 4.
Dash also costs mana.
Ocelots can now use dwarf items that cost mana.
-> Reason: Focus was mainly on making the Ocelot more unique. Stealing mana now allows them to also use dwarf Magic Potions or Pearl Rods. Dash/Speed was reverted to make the Ocelot focus more on getting in, stealing mana, getting out without making it too annoying for dwarves. Disarm was changed to make it easier not to hit other mobs, due to the mobs affecting other mobs change.
